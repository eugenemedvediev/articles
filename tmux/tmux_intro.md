#Tmux 8 hours per day. (Intro)

%% Today I want to share with you my findings about Terminal multiplexer (tmux).

##Intro.
One of the most important processes of our life is control. 
We do want to have control over our life.
At the same time, most people spend a third part of their lives at work. 
Naturally, we do want to keep control at work, starting from using a password 
to login to our system, finishing with setting up the look and feel of our 
operating system to own it.  What about the terminal? Do we own a terminal, do 
we control it, or it is the only bunch of strings with the blinking cursor?
How we can control it, how we can make it feel that we own it? How we make it
work for us?

##Possible questions.
I would like to list and answer some questions which possibly you could have:
- Should I care or know about tmux at all?
- How tmux could improve my performance as developer?
- How much time should I invest to became productive in tmux?
- Alternatives to tmux?
- Where to start? 
- What's next?

##Possible answers.
- Should I care or know about tmux at all?
Personally, first time I heard about tmux after 15 years of my carrier in IT. So
you definitely can live and be productive enough (depends on area) about tmux.
The question is what is your area. Are you Product Owner,
Scrum Master, UI/UX designer? There is a high probability that you would find my
thoughts about tmux attractive. Are you QA, devops, developer? You are my
audience. If you find yourself familiar with terminal, there is 100% hit.
I can assume that you use Putty, iTerm2 or standard terminal application every
day. This is good start as you know what command line is. So you know what you
can do in command line and want to make your experience with it more fluent. You
want to use multiple command lines to execute different commands in parallel.
What you do normally? Open another terminal window or open another tab, or even
open new pane (Ex. iTerm2). Soon you can find yourself juggling with windows, or
trying to find necessary tab or pane using mouse. You loose your time, you loose
your focus, you loose your energy.
Tmux could solve this problem. Not instantly, but for sure.
So if you read article to this point, then you should care about having tmux in
your toolbox.

- How tmux could improve my performance as IT specialist?
Partially I answered this question in previous paragraph. 
Tmux is aimed to add structure and easy management of your multiple
terminals (panes in tmux terms).
You would be able in short time switch to necessary terminal (pane), give names
to the tmux windows (logical groups of panes), and also give names to the tmux
sessions (logical groups of tmux windows). You can navigate and search sessions
and windows by name. Also easy navigate inside your tmux setup using only
keyboard. Yes, you should learn hotkeys, but it gives you big boost in the
future. You will jump between sessions, windows and panes like true hacker ( at
least it looks cool :) )

- How much time should I invest to became productive in tmux?
I can share my experience in learning tmux. The first primitive improvement I
start to feel after 1 week of using tmux. Before I was using iTerm2 and made
horizontal and vertical splits, and navigating between them with keyboard only,
but still it was not enough mature experience.
Tmux gives feeling of solid technology which will work on any terminal emulator
(iTerm, terminal, putty, alacrity, name it). There is whole book written about
tmux. Yes you can learn small things here and there, but foundation is not
complex and you can learn it in 1 day. If you switch to tmux and will use it
everyday, you will quickly realize that your time investment is profitable.
Minimal setup. I plan to write next article about tmux basics. 

- Is it easy to personalize tmux look and feel?
After some short period of time you possible would want to customize tmux look
and feel for your taste. I didn't change much, just colors of bottom panel and
made it minimalistic. It is pretty simple to change tmux.conf file and see the
result.

- Alternatives to tmux?
According to https://alternativeto.net/software/tmux/ there are a lot of
alternatives to tmux for my big surprise, but the only one about I heard from
this list before is screen, which has limited functionality comparing to tmux.

- Where to start? 
You can start to read about tmux on it's github page
https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki. There you can find the instruction how to
install it on different platforms. The easiest way is to try it by yourself.

- What's next?
%% insert here link to the next article or announce it.
I plan to write small article about basic tmux terms and how to make simple and
minimalistic setup. Stay tuned.
